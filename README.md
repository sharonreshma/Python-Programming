# NLP with NLTK and SpaCy using Anaconda

## Overview

This project demonstrates natural language processing (NLP) tasks using NLTK and SpaCy libraries in Python, managed through Anaconda. It covers tokenization, POS tagging, named entity recognition (NER), stopwords removal, chunking, chinking, and grammar checking.

## Features

- **Tokenization**: Break text into tokens (words or phrases).
- **POS Tagging**: Assign grammatical tags to tokens (noun, verb, etc.).
- **NER**: Identify and classify named entities (persons, organizations, locations).
- **Stopwords Removal**: Filter out common words that do not carry significant meaning.
- **Chunking**: Group tokens into chunks based on grammatical patterns.
- **Chinking**: Remove parts from chunks that do not fit specific patterns.
- **Grammar Checking**: Detect and correct grammatical errors in text.

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: Programming language for NLP development.
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit for NLP tasks such as tokenization, POS tagging, and grammar checking.
- **SpaCy**: Advanced NLP library for tokenization, POS tagging, NER, and efficient text processing.
- **Anaconda**: Platform for managing Python environments and packages, including NLTK and SpaCy installations.

## Setup

1. **Install Anaconda**: Download and install Anaconda from [Anaconda Website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

2. **Create Anaconda Environment**: Open Anaconda Prompt or terminal and create a new environment:
   ```bash
   conda create --name nlp-env python=3.8
   conda activate nlp-env
